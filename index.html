    <h1>Mid-century Modern (MCM) Architecture</h1>
    <p>"<Strong>Midcentury-modern architecture</Strong> is a style created by architects in the middle decades of the <strong>20th century.</strong>
        Influenced by the optimism of the post-World War II boom and by the exploration of a range of materials,
        including <strong>steel, concrete,</strong> and newly available <strong>insulated glass,</strong> the mainstays of midcentury-modern architecture 
        remain appealing to this day."</p>
